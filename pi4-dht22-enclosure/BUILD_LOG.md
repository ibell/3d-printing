## 2026-07-25 — model complete, unprinted

Tray + snap-fit lid + DHT22 sensor arm modeled in `pi4_dht22_enclosure.scad`.
All five printable parts (`sensor_gauge`, `arm`, `tray`, `lid`, `fit_coupon`)
render as single watertight bodies with positive volume and pass
`tests/check_geom.py`. Nothing printed in plastic yet.

**Design change during implementation: lid screws → snap-fit.** The plan
called for a lid closed with 4 × M3 screws into corner bosses on the tray. Once
modeled, the bosses collided with the standoffs and fouled the Pi board — the
board fills the tray too tightly to leave room for both. Switched the lid to a
snap-fit instead: ridge/groove segments on the two walled sides (x-min/SD and
+Y/GPIO), flanking the SD notch and the arm socket. No lid screws or bosses in
the current model. The Pi-to-standoff fasteners (four M2.5 self-tapping
screws) and the arm-in-socket set screw (one M3) are unaffected.

Two things worth flagging for anyone printing this before further tuning:

- **The snap is stiff as modeled** (2.8 mm engaging skirt). Expect a firm push
  to seat the lid on first fit. If it's tighter than wanted, thin the skirt
  (`snap_ridge_h`) or deepen the ridge/groove.
- **Only two of four sides latch.** The two open port-channel sides don't
  snap, so the lid can lift slightly at that free corner. Acceptable for a
  stationary desk unit, not for anything that gets carried around or shipped.

Next: print `stl/sensor_gauge.stl` first and confirm the DHT22 module
(37 × 10 × 10 mm default) drops in with a firm grip; then `stl/fit_coupon.stl`
against the real Pi; then the production `tray`, `lid`, and `arm`.
